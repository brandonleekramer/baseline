**Baseline & Stress Study**

Authors: Brandon Kramer (University of Virginia), Mary Himmelstein (Kent State University), Kristen Springer (Rutgers University), and Nathaniel Ratcliff (University of Virginia)

Using a sample of 232 undergraduates from a major Northeastern university in the United States, we examine the most effective procedures for reducing participants' physiological measures to the most relaxed "baseline" level. These six different baseline conditions include a color block task, filling out questionnaires, listening to music, resting with no stimuli, watching a video documentary, and reading magazines.
